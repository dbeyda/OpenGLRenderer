The model is subdivision ready.
This is just the base mesh,
Use a subdivision surface to get smother geometry.

I use the spec gloss texture work flow and i have added those textures. 
The texture files were created in substance painter but later modified in Photoshop.
Creating new textures will be a long process for another texture workflow.
Look online if you want to use the spec gloss workflow. It is quite simple.

Feel free to use the model if you want but please "Do mention my name if you use it".
Thnx for reading.
